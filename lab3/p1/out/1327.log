slurmstepd: error: *** JOB 1327 ON hpcl1-1 CANCELLED AT 2019-10-02T12:24:33 DUE TO TIME LIMIT ***
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
ORTE has lost communication with a remote daemon.

  HNP daemon   : [[4498,0],0] on node hpcl1-1
  Remote daemon: [[4498,0],4] on node hpcl1-5

This is usually due to either a failure of the TCP network
connection to the node, or possibly an internal failure of
the daemon itself. We cannot recover from this failure, and
therefore will terminate the job.
